Prior research establishes that narrative disclosures convey economically meaningful information that is incorporated into stock prices. Studies show that linguistic features of financial news predict earnings and short-term stock returns, and that investors underreact to qualitative signals embedded in text \citep{tetlock2008morethanwords}. Focusing specifically on regulatory filings, evidence indicates that changes in MD&A content and tone are associated with abnormal stock returns around filing dates, even after controlling for earnings surprises and accruals, highlighting the incremental information content of managerial narratives \citep{feldman2010tone, browntucker2011mda}.
Despite this evidence, most disclosure-based event studies rely on a single class of sentiment or textual measures—typically dictionary-based word counts—when assessing market reactions to narrative disclosures. Methodological surveys emphasize that such measures are inherently noisy and sensitive to implementation choices, raising concerns about measurement error in inference on disclosure informativeness \citep{loughranmcdonald2016survey}. As a result, it remains unclear whether conclusions about the magnitude and timing of market reactions to narrative disclosures are robust to alternative approaches for extracting sentiment from text.
This issue is particularly salient in non-English disclosure regimes, where linguistic structure and institutional formatting may further distort dictionary-based measures. While recent studies applying modern language models to Japanese corporate texts document return predictability at longer horizons, existing work provides limited evidence on whether alternative sentiment extraction methods yield systematically different short-window abnormal return responses around disclosure events, and thus whether measurement choice materially affects economic inference in standard event-study settings.
