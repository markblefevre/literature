While a large literature shows that narrative disclosures contain information that is reflected in asset prices, most studies rely on a single class of sentiment measures when evaluating market reactions to corporate filings. As a result, little is known about how sensitive inferences about disclosure informativeness are to the underlying method used to extract sentiment from text. This issue is particularly salient in non-English disclosure regimes, where linguistic structure and regulatory formatting may exacerbate measurement error and attenuate estimated announcement effects. Although recent studies applying modern language models to Japanese corporate texts document return predictability at longer horizons, it remains unclear whether alternative sentiment extraction approaches yield systematically different short-window abnormal return responses around disclosure events, and whether such differences affect conclusions about how markets incorporate narrative information at the time of disclosure.
